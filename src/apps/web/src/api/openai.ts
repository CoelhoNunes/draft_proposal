1. **Executive Summary Enhancement**: Add a compelling executive summary that highlights your organization's commitment to FedRAMP compliance and the business value of your security controls.

2. **Risk Management Framework**: Detail your comprehensive risk management approach including threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, and continuous monitoring capabilities.

3. **Compliance Monitoring**: Describe your automated compliance monitoring systems that provide real-time visibility into security posture and regulatory adherence.

4. **Incident Response Excellence**: Outline your 24/7 incident response capabilities with specific response times, escalation procedures, and post-incident analysis processes.

Would you like me to add any of these suggestions to your draft?`;

1. **FIDO2 Implementation**: Deploy FIDO2/WebAuthn standards for phishing-resistant authentication across all user accounts.

2. **Adaptive Authentication**: Implement risk-based authentication that adjusts security requirements based on user behavior, location, and device trust.

3. **Hardware Token Support**: Provide hardware security keys for privileged accounts and high-risk operations.

4. **Biometric Integration**: Support biometric authentication on compatible devices while maintaining fallback options.
